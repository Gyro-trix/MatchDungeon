# Match Dungeon(Working Title)

## Creating a game using what I have learned in HTML, CSS, and Javascript from prior projects

Match Dungeon is a pattern recognition game that requires the player to move a character around the screen and "defeat" objects in a certain order.
The desired pattern is displayed somewhere on the "level" in the form of a visual hint.
Hints can be also obtained from a button on screen, producing a text hint.
