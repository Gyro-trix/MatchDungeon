# Match Dungeon(Working Title)

## Creating a game using what I have learned in HTML, CSS, and Javascript from prior projects

Match Dungeon is a pattern recognition game that requires the player to move a character around the screen and "defeat" objects in a certain order.
The desired pattern is displayed somewhere on the "level" in the form of a visual hint.
Hints can be also obtained from a button on screen, producing a text hint.

## Mechanics

Arrow buttons on screen and on the keyboard to move the player character

A button to either pickup or attack a nearby object

A pause button, reset, and information button

Hint button to give a generic hint depending on level

## Mechanics

Create a player character that is controlled by buttons or using the arrows on the keyboard.

Multiple Levels with different puzzles to solve

A score system that is tied to how fast a level is completed

A progress display on the puzzle completion

## Left to Add



Create sprites and graphics

Maybe sounds (will be pretty simple)

## For later

Make a boss

refine code to use only on object instead of multiple that use x, y, and width
